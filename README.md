Hi Mr. Lee, 

Thanks for being a great teacher this semester, I learned a lot of new things in ICS and enjoyed this class ğŸ˜€














If I do well on the culminating, could you please possibly boost my average by a little to 100 so I hopefully maybe I can stand a chance for Waterloo ğŸ¥²































Just kidding I get whatever mark I earned ğŸ˜”

A totally great student,
