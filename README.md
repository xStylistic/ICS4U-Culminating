Hi Mr. Lee, 

Thanks for being a great teacher this semester. I learned a lot of new things in ICS and enjoyed this class. Please possibly boost my average by a little to 100 so I hopefully maybe I could stand a chance for Waterloo. Just kidding I get whatever mark I earned. 

A totally great student, 
Bonny
